## Homework (due Tuesday 12/6)

- Finish Open Weather Map project (3_jquery_ajax_exercise folder)
    - Bonus items (input boxes and Kelvin -> Fahrenheit conversion) are optional
    - Add forecast.io as a second data source (documentation at https://developer.forecast.io). How you integrate the new data into the web page is up to you — it can replace the temperature returned by Open Weather Map, you can show both forecasts, or you can create an interface that gives users a choice of which to view.

New in 08-dom-jquery-cont folder:
- Complete exercise in 7_query_homework folder (uses chaining, event delegation, and implicit iteration)
