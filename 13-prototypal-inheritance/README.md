## Homework (due Tuesday 12/20)

- Exercise in `10-homework-stocks` folder:
    - Create a `stocks` constructor, using the `prototype` property to minimize the number of properties and methods that are created for each new object that is constructed. 
    - Be sure to test as described in the stocks.js file.
    - If you want to make your code awesome, there are a couple bonus items you can add to your project.
